# Face-Recognition-model
A facial recognition system using Python. This project utilises machine learning techniques to perform face recognition on the LFW dataset
The code first fetches the dataset and preprocesses it by splitting it into a training and testing set. It then applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. A neural network classifier is trained on the transformed training data. The trained model is then used to predict the labels of the test data. The classification results are evaluated using a classification report. Additionally, the code visualizes the predicted faces and eigenfaces (principal components) using matplotlib
